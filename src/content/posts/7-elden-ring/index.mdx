Shadow of the Erdtree is easily the best expansion ever made, offering far more
gameplay than most standalone games, and adding so much to an already brilliant
base game.

It has my vote for Game of the Year, but the people making
the decision aren't going to give the award to a
<abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr>. They'll likely go with
[Astro Bot](https://www.teamasobi.com/games/astro-bot), a fine game, and
worthy winner, despite only being available on PS5.

I rarely play games twice, but I completed Elden Ring **three** times in a
row earlier this year, achieving **Platinum** status on my final playthrough.

Elden Ring changed me. It feels like an epic fantasy novel brought to life,
where an unlikely hero on a long, lonely journey must
forge a path through a fragmented realm
haunted by enigmatic characters with hidden agendas.

It awakened my dormant love of reading, _and writing_, and kept me up late pondering
the complex connections between the characters, and their likely motivations.

I wonder what [FromSoftware](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/) will do next.
Many would like to see a [Bloodborne](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne/) sequel,
but I want another Elden Ring game where we learn more
about the Gloam-Eyed Queen and her links to both Melina and Ranni.
What exactly happened on the Night of the Black Knives, and how do the
Godskin Apostles fit into the story?

It doesn't matter to me if Shadow of the Erdtree wins Game Of The Year or not,
Elden Ring was a triumph, and FromSoftware has raised the bar.

What a time to be a gamer.
